# Built-in React APIs

In addition to [Hooks](https://react.dev/reference/react) and [Components](https://react.dev/reference/react/components), the `react` package exports a few other APIs that are useful for defining components. This page lists all the remaining modern React APIs.

- [`createContext`](https://react.dev/reference/react/createContext) lets you define and provide context to the child components. Used with [`useContext`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useContext).
- [`forwardRef`](https://react.dev/reference/react/forwardRef) lets your component expose a DOM node as a ref to the parent. Used with [`useRef`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useRef).
- [`lazy`](https://react.dev/reference/react/lazy) lets you defer loading a component’s code until it’s rendered for the first time.
- [`memo`](https://react.dev/reference/react/memo) lets your component skip re-renders with same props. Used with [`useMemo`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useMemo) and [`useCallback`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useCallback).
- [`startTransition`](https://react.dev/reference/react/startTransition) lets you mark a state update as non-urgent. Similar to [`useTransition`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition).
